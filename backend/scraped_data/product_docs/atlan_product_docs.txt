Title: Set up Snowflake | Atlan Documentation
Content: Connect dataData WarehousesSnowflakeGet StartedSet up SnowflakeOn this pageSet up SnowflakeWho can do this?You need your Snowflake administrator to run these commands - you may not have access yourself. Create user and role in Snowflake​ Create a role and user in Snowflake using the following commands: Create role​ Create a role in Snowflake using the following commands: CREATE OR REPLACE ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT OPERATE, USAGE ON WAREHOUSE "<warehouse-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Replace <warehouse-name> with the default warehouse to use when running the Snowflake crawler. Atlan requires the following privileges to: OPERATE enables Atlan to start the virtual warehouse to fetch metadata if the warehouse has stopped. USAGE enables Atlan to show or list metadata from Snowflake. This in turn enables the Snowflake crawler to run the SHOW query. Create a user​ Create a separate user to integrate into Atlan, using one of the following 3 options: With a public key in Snowflake​ See Snowflake's official guide for details on generating an RSA key-pair. To create a user with a key-pair, replace the value for rsa_public_key with the public key and run the following: CREATE USER atlan_user rsa_public_key='MIIBIjANBgkqh...' default_role=atlan_user_role default_warehouse='<warehouse-name>' display_name='Atlan'TYPE = 'SERVICE' Learn more about the SERVICE type property in Snowflake documentation. Did you know?Atlan only supports encrypted private keys with a non-empty passphrase - generally recommended as more secure. An empty passphrase results in workflow failures. To generate an encrypted private key, omit the -nocrypt option. Refer to Snowflake documentation to learn more. With a password in Snowflake​ Did you know?Snowflake recommends transitioning away from basic authentication using username and password. Change to key-pair authentication for enhanced security. For any existing Snowflake workflows, you can modify the crawler configuration to update the authentication method. To create a user with a password, replace <password> and run the following: CREATE USER atlan_user password='<password>' default_role=atlan_user_role default_warehouse='<warehouse-name>' display_name='Atlan'TYPE = 'LEGACY_SERVICE' Learn more about the LEGACY_SERVICE type property in Snowflake documentation. Managed through your identity provider (IdP) Private preview​ This method is currently only available if Okta is your IdP (Snowflake supports) authenticating natively through Okta: Create a user in your identity provider (IdP) and use federated authentication in Snowflake. The password for this user must be maintained solely in the IdP and multi-factor authentication (MFA) must be disabled. Grant role to user​ To grant the atlan_user_role to the new user: GRANT ROLE atlan_user_role TO USER atlan_user; Configure OAuth (client credentials flow) with Microsoft Entra ID​ To configure OAuth authentication using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) with the client credentials flow: Follow Snowflake's documentation to: Register a new application in Microsoft Entra ID Collect the client ID, tenant ID, and client secret Add the required API permissions In Snowflake, create a security integration using the following: CREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION external_oauth_azure_ad TYPE = external_oauth ENABLED = true EXTERNAL_OAUTH_TYPE = azure EXTERNAL_OAUTH_ISSUER = '\<AZURE_AD_ISSUER\>' EXTERNAL_OAUTH_JWS_KEYS_URL = '\<AZURE_AD_JWS_KEY_ENDPOINT\>' EXTERNAL_OAUTH_AUDIENCE_LIST = ('\<SNOWFLAKE_APPLICATION_ID_URI\>') EXTERNAL_OAUTH_TOKEN_USER_MAPPING_CLAIM = 'sub' EXTERNAL_OAUTH_SNOWFLAKE_USER_MAPPING_ATTRIBUTE = 'login_name'; Replace the placeholders with actual values from your Azure AD app: <AZURE_AD_ISSUER> → Your tenant's OAuth 2.0 issuer URL <AZURE_AD_JWS_KEY_ENDPOINT> → Azure JWKs URI <SNOWFLAKE_APPLICATION_ID_URI> → Application ID URI of the Azure app Create a Snowflake user with a login name that exactly matches the Azure AD client object ID: CREATE USER oauth_svc_user WITH LOGIN_NAME = '\<AZURE_AD_CLIENT_OBJECT_ID\>' -- Use Azure client OBJECT ID DEFAULT_ROLE = \<ROLE\> DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = \<WAREHOUSE\>; Grant the configured role to this user: GRANT ROLE \<ROLE\> TO USER oauth_svc_user; Choose metadata fetching method​ Atlan supports two methods for fetching metadata from Snowflake - account usage and information schema. You should choose one of these two methods to set up Snowflake: Account usageInformation schemaOverviewSimplified grants but some limitations in functionalityMost comprehensive approach, more grant management requiredMethodViews in the SNOWFLAKE database that display object metadata and usage metrics for your accountSystem-defined views and table functions that provide extensive metadata for objects created in your accountPermissionsUser role and account, single grant for SNOWFLAKE databaseUser role and account, multiple grants per databaseData latency45 minutes to 3 hours (varies by view)NoneHistorical data retention1 year7 days to 6 months (varies by view or table function)Asset extractionACCOUNT_USAGE schemaINFORMATION_SCHEMA schemaView lineageACCOUNT_USAGE schemaINFORMATION_SCHEMA schemaTable lineageACCOUNT_USAGE schemaACCOUNT_USAGE schemaTag importACCOUNT_USAGE schemaACCOUNT_USAGE schemaUsage and popularityACCOUNT_USAGE schemaACCOUNT_USAGE schemaMetadata extraction timeVaries by warehouse size. For example, 8 minutes for 10 million assets (recommended for extracting a large number of assets)Varies by warehouse size. For example, 2+ hours for 10 million assetsExtraction limitationsExternal table location data, procedures, and primary and foreign keysNone Grant permissions for account usage method​ warningIf you want to set warehouse timeouts when using this method, set a large value initially for the workflow to succeed. Once the workflow has succeeded, adjust the value to be twice the extraction time. This method uses the views in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE (or a copied version of this schema) to fetch the metadata from Snowflake into Atlan. You can be more granular with permissions using this method, but there are limitations with this approach. To crawl assets, generate lineage, and import tags​ If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. If you're using the account usage method to crawl metadata in Atlan or you have configured the Snowflake miner, you need to grant the same permissions to import tags as required for crawling Snowflake assets. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher. To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE atlan_user_role; The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE "<copied-database>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "<copied-schema>" IN DATABASE "<copied-database>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE "<copied-database>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Replace <copied-database> with the copied Snowflake database name. Replace <copied-schema> with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone. To crawl streams​ To crawl streams, provide the following permissions: To crawl current streams: GRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON ALL STREAMS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Replace <database-name> with the Snowflake database name. To crawl future streams: GRANT USAGE ON FUTURE SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE TABLES IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE STREAMS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Replace <database-name> with the Snowflake database name. (Optional) To preview and query existing assets​ To query and preview data within assets that already exist in Snowflake, add these permissions: GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON ALL EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON ALL MATERIALIZED VIEWS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON ALL STREAMS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT MONITOR ON PIPE "<pipe-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Replace <database-name> with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to preview and query in Atlan.) (Optional) To preview and query future assets​ To query and preview data within assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. GRANT USAGE ON FUTURE SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE VIEWS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE MATERIALIZED VIEWS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE STREAMS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT MONITOR ON FUTURE PIPES IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Replace <database-name> with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to preview and query in Atlan.) warningVerify that all the assets you'd like to crawl are present in these grants by checking the grants on the user role defined for the crawler. Grant permissions for information schema method​ This method uses views in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in Snowflake databases to fetch metadata. You still need to grant specific permissions to enable Atlan to crawl metadata, preview data, and query data with this method. To crawl existing assets​ Grant these permissions to crawl assets that already exist in Snowflake. If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Grant permissions to crawl existing assets: GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL MATERIALIZED VIEWS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON ALL STREAMS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT MONITOR ON PIPE "<pipe-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Replace <database-name> with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) Grant permissions to crawl functions: GRANT USAGE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Replace <database-name> with the database you want to be available in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to integrate into Atlan.) For secure user-defined functions (UDFs), grant OWNERSHIP permissions to retrieve metadata: GRANT OWNERSHIP ON FUNCTION <schema_name>.<udf_name> TO ROLE <role_name>; Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values: <schema_name>: The name of the schema that contains the user-defined function (UDF). <udf_name>: The name of the secure UDF that requires ownership permissions. <role_name>: The role that gets assigned ownership of the secure UDF. Did you know?The statements given on this page apply to all schemas, tables, and views in a database in Snowflake. If you want to limit access to only certain objects, you can instead specify the exact objects individually as well. To crawl future assets​ To crawl assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. To grant permissions at a database level: GRANT USAGE ON FUTURE SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE TABLES IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE VIEWS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE MATERIALIZED VIEWS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE STREAMS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT MONITOR ON FUTURE PIPES IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT USAGE ON FUTURE FUNCTIONS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Replace <database-name> with the database you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to integrate into Atlan.) warningFor any future grants defined at a schema level to a different role, the schema-level grants take precedence over the database-level grants and any future grants defined at a database level to the Atlan role get ignored. To learn more, refer to Snowflake documentation. To grant permissions at a schema level: GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA "<database-name>.<schema-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE EXTERNAL TABLES IN SCHEMA "<database-name>.<schema-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE VIEWS IN SCHEMA "<database-name>.<schema-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE MATERIALIZED VIEWS IN SCHEMA "<database-name>.<schema-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE STREAMS IN SCHEMA "<database-name>.<schema-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT MONITOR ON FUTURE PIPES IN SCHEMA "<database-name>.<schema-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Replace <database-name> with the database and <schema-name> with the schema you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to integrate into Atlan.) To mine query history for lineage​ To also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), add these permissions. You can use either option: To mine query history direct from Snowflake's internal tables: USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE snowflake TO ROLE atlan_user_role; To mine query history from a cloned or copied set of tables, where you can also remove any sensitive data: GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE "<cloned-database>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "<cloned-database>"."<cloned-account-usage-schema>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA "<cloned-database>"."<cloned-account-usage-schema>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN SCHEMA "<cloned-database>"."<cloned-account-usage-schema>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Replace <cloned-database> with the name of the cloned database, and <cloned-account-usage-schema> with the name of the cloned schema containing account usage details. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone. (Optional) To preview and query existing assets​ To query and preview data within assets that already exist in Snowflake, add these permissions: GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON ALL EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON ALL MATERIALIZED VIEWS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON ALL STREAMS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT MONITOR ON PIPE "<pipe-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Replace <database-name> with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you wish to preview and query in Atlan.) (Optional) To preview and query future assets​ To query and preview data within assets that may be created in the future in Snowflake, add these permissions. Again, if you want to also be able to preview and query the data for future assets, you can add the preview and query future assets permissions instead. GRANT USAGE ON FUTURE SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE VIEWS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE MATERIALIZED VIEWS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE STREAMS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT MONITOR ON FUTURE PIPES IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Replace <database-name> with the database you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database you want to preview and query in Atlan.) warningFor any future grants defined at a schema level to a different role, the schema-level grants take precedence over the database-level grants and any future grants defined at a database level to the Atlan role get ignored. To learn more, refer to Snowflake documentation. To grant permissions at a schema level: GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA "<database-name>.<schema-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE EXTERNAL TABLES IN SCHEMA "<database-name>.<schema-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE VIEWS IN SCHEMA "<database-name>.<schema-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE MATERIALIZED VIEWS IN SCHEMA "<database-name>.<schema-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE STREAMS IN SCHEMA "<database-name>.<schema-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT MONITOR ON FUTURE PIPES IN SCHEMA "<database-name>.<schema-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Replace <database-name> with the database and <schema-name> with the schema you want to be able to preview and query in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to preview and query in Atlan.) warningVerify that all the assets you'd like to crawl are present in these grants by checking the grants on the user role defined for the crawler. (Optional) To import Snowflake tags​ Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher. To import tags from Snowflake, grant these permissions: To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE atlan_user_role; The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE "<copied-database>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "<copied-schema>" IN DATABASE "<copied-database>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE "<copied-database>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Replace <copied-database> with the copied Snowflake database name. Replace <copied-schema> with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. (Optional) To push updated tags to Snowflake​ To push tags updated for assets in Atlan to Snowflake, grant these permissions: GRANT APPLY TAG ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE <role-name>; You can learn more about tag privileges from Snowflake documentation. (Optional) To crawl dynamic tables​ Atlan currently supports fetching metadata for dynamic tables using the MONITOR privilege. Refer to Snowflake documentation to learn more. To crawl existing dynamic tables from Snowflake: Grant permissions at a database level: GRANT MONITOR ON ALL DYNAMIC TABLES IN DATABASE "<DATABASE_NAME>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Grant permissions at a schema level: GRANT MONITOR ON ALL DYNAMIC TABLES IN SCHEMA "<database-name>.<schema-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role; To crawl future dynamic tables from Snowflake: Grant permissions at a database level: GRANT MONITOR ON FUTURE DYNAMIC TABLES IN DATABASE "<DATABASE_NAME>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Grant permissions at a schema level: GRANT MONITOR ON FUTURE DYNAMIC TABLES IN SCHEMA "<database-name>.<schema-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Replace <database-name> with the database and <schema-name> with the schema you want to crawl in Atlan. (Repeat the statements for every database and schema you want to integrate into Atlan.) (Optional) To crawl Iceberg tables​ Atlan currently supports fetching metadata for Iceberg tables only for the information schema extraction method. To crawl Iceberg tables from Snowflake, grant the following permissions: To crawl existing Iceberg tables in Snowflake: GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL ICEBERG TABLES IN DATABASE <database-name> TO ROLE atlan_user_role; To crawl future Iceberg tables in Snowflake: GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE ICEBERG TABLES IN DATABASE <database-name> TO ROLE atlan_user_role; To crawl Iceberg catalog metadata for Iceberg tables in Snowflake: GRANT USAGE ON INTEGRATION <integration-name> TO ROLE atlan_user_role; warningYou must first grant permissions to crawl existing Iceberg tables for this permission to work on catalogs. You must also grant permissions to all the catalogs you want to crawl in Atlan individually. (Optional) To crawl Snowflake stages​ Atlan supports crawling metadata for Snowflake stages using the USAGE and READ privileges. For more information, see the Snowflake documentation for INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STAGES. To crawl stages from Snowflake: Grant USAGE and READ privileges on all existing stages at the database level: GRANT USAGE ON ALL STAGES IN DATABASE <database_name> TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT READ ON ALL STAGES IN DATABASE <database_name> TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Replace <database_name> with the name of your Snowflake database Replace <atlan_user_role> with the role you've granted Atlan to use for crawling. Grant USAGE and READ privileges on all future stages at the database level: GRANT USAGE ON FUTURE STAGES IN DATABASE <database_name> TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT READ ON FUTURE STAGES IN DATABASE <database_name> TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Replace <database_name> with the name of your Snowflake database Replace <atlan_user_role> with the role you've granted Atlan to use for crawling. Allowlist the Atlan IP​ If you are using the IP allowlist in your Snowflake instance, you must add the Atlan IP to the allowlist. Please raise a support ticket from within Atlan, or submit a request.

Title: Set up Databricks | Atlan Documentation
Content: Connect dataData WarehousesDatabricksGet StartedSet up DatabricksOn this pageSet up DatabricksAtlan supports three authentication methods for fetching metadata from Databricks. You can set up any of the following authentication methods: Personal access token authentication AWS service principal authentication Azure service principal authentication Personal access token authentication​ Who can do this?Check that you have Admin and Databricks SQL access for the Databricks workspace. This is required for both cluster options described below. If you don't have this access, contact your Databricks administrator. Grant user access to workspace​ To grant workspace access to the user creating a personal access token: From the left  of the account console, click Workspaces and then select a workspace to which you want to add the user. From the tabs along the top of your workspace page, click the Permissions tab. In the upper right of the Permissions page, click Add permissions. In the Add permissions dialog, enter the following details: For User, group, or service principal, select the user to grant access. For Permission, click the dropdown and select workspace User. Generate a personal access token​ You can generate a personal access token in your Databricks workspace to the authenticate the integration in Atlan. To generate a personal access token: From the top right of your Databricks workspace, click your Databricks username, and then from the dropdown, click User Settings. Under the Settings , click Developer. On the Developer page, next to Access tokens, click Manage. On the Access tokens page, click the Generate new token button. In the Generate new token dialog: For Comment, enter a description of the token's intended use - for example, Atlan crawler. For Lifetime (days), consider removing the number. This enables the token to be used indefinitely - it won't need to be refreshed. Important!If you do enter a number, remember that you need to periodically regenerate it and update Atlan's crawler configuration with the new token each time. At the bottom of the dialog, click Generate. Copy and save the generated token in a secure location, and then click Done. Select a cluster​ Did you know?Atlan recommends using serverless SQL warehouses for instant compute availability. To enable serverless SQL warehouses, refer to Databricks documentation for AWS Databricks workspaces or Microsoft documentation for Azure Databricks workspaces. You can set up personal access token authentication for your Databricks instance using one of the following cluster options: Interactive cluster SQL warehouse (formerly SQL endpoint) Interactive cluster​ To confirm an all-purpose interactive cluster is configured: From the left  of any page of your Databricks instance, click Compute. Under the All-purpose clusters tab, verify you have a cluster defined. Click the link under the Name column of the table to open your cluster. Under the Configuration tab, verify the Autopilot options to Terminate after ... minutes is enabled. At the bottom of the Configuration tab, expand the Advanced options expandable. Under the Advanced options expandable, open the JDBC/ODBC tab. Confirm that all of the fields in this tab are populated, and copy them for use in crawling: Server Hostname, Port, and HTTP Path. SQL warehouse (formerly SQL endpoint)​ To confirm a SQL warehouse is configured: From the left  of any page of your Databricks instance, open the dropdown just below the databricks logo and change to SQL. From the refreshed left , click SQL Warehouses. Click the link under the Name column of the table to open your SQL warehouse. Under the Connection details tab, confirm that all of the fields are populated and copy them for use in crawling: Server hostname, Port, and HTTP path. AWS service principal authentication​ Who can do this?You need your AWS Databricks account admin to create a service principal and manage OAuth credentials for the service principal and your AWS Databricks workspace admin to add the service principal to your AWS Databricks workspace - you may not have access yourself. You need the following to authenticate the connection in Atlan: Client ID Client secret Create a service principal​ You can create a service principal directly in your Databricks account or from a Databricks workspace. Identity federation enabled on your workspaces: Databricks recommends creating the service principal in the account and assigning it to workspaces. Identity federation disabled on your workspaces: Databricks recommends that you create your service principal from a workspace. Identity federation enabled​ To create a service principal from your Databricks account, with identify federation enabled: Log in to your Databricks account console as an account admin. From the left  of the account console, click User management. From the tabs along the top of the User management page, click the Service principals tab. In the upper right of the Service principals page, click Add service principal. On the Add service principal page, enter a name for the service principal and then click Add. Once the service principal has been created, you can assign it to your identity federated workspace. From the left  of the account console, click Workspaces and then select a workspace to which you want to add the service principal. From the tabs along the top of your workspace page, click the Permissions tab. In the upper right of the Permissions page, click Add permissions. In the Add permissions dialog, enter the following details: For User, group, or service principal, select the service principal you created. For Permission, click the dropdown and select workspace User. Identity federation disabled​ To create a service principal from a Databricks workspace, with identity federation disabled: Log in to your AWS Databricks workspace as a workspace admin. From the top right of your workspace, click your username, and then from the dropdown, click Admin Settings. In the left  of the Settings page, under the Workspace admin subheading, click Identity and access. On the Identity and access page, under Management and permissions, next to Service principals, click Manage. In the upper right of the Service principals page, click Add service principal. In the Add service principal dialog, click the Add new button. For New service principal display name, enter a name for the service principal and then click Add. Create an OAuth secret for the service principal​ You need to create an OAuth secret to authenticate to Databricks REST APIs. To create an OAuth secret for the service principal: Log in to your Databricks account console as an account admin. From the left  of the account console, click User management. From the tabs along the top of the User management page, click the Service principals tab. In the upper right of the Service principals page, select the service principal you created. On the service principal page, under OAuth secrets, click Generate secret. From the Generate secret dialog, copy the Secret and Client ID and store it in a secure location. Important!Note that this secret is only revealed once during creation. The client ID is the same as the application ID of the service principal. Once you've copied the client ID and secret, click Done. Azure service principal authentication​ Who can do this?You need your Azure Databricks account admin to create a service principal and your Azure Databricks workspace admin to add the service principal to your Azure Databricks workspace - you may not have access yourself. You need the following to authenticate the connection in Atlan: Client ID (application ID) Client secret Tenant ID (directory ID) Create a service principal​ To use service principals on Azure Databricks, an admin user must create a new Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) application and then add it to the Azure Databricks workspace to use as a service principal. To create a service principal: Sign in to the Azure portal. If you have access to multiple tenants, subscriptions, or directories, click the Directories + subscriptions (directory with filter) icon in the top  to switch to the directory in which you want to create the service principal. In_Search resources, services, and docs_, search for and selectMicrosoft Entra ID. Click**+ Addand selectApp registration**. For_Name_, enter a name for the application. In the_Supported account types_section, selectAccounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant) and then click Register. On the application page's_Overview_page, in the_Essentials_section, copy and store the following values in a secure location: Application (client) ID Directory (tenant) ID To generate a client secret, within_Manage_, clickCertificates & secrets. On the_Client secrets_tab, clickNew client secret. In the_Add a client secret_dialog, enter the following details: For Description, enter a description for the client secret. For_Expires_, select an expiry time period for the client secret and then click Add. Copy and store the client secret's_Value_in a secure place. Add a service principal to your account​ To add a service principal to your Azure Databricks account: Log in to your Azure Databricks account console as an account admin. From the left  of the account console, click User management. From the tabs along the top of the User management page, click the Service principals tab. In the upper right of the Service principals page, click Add service principal. On the Add service principal page, enter a name for the service principal. Under UUID, paste the Application (client) ID for the service principal. Click Add. Assign a service principal to a workspace​ To add users to a workspace using the account console, the workspace must be enabled for identity federation.

Grant permissions to crawl metadata​ You must have a Unity Catalog-enabled Databricks workspace to crawl metadata in Atlan. To extract metadata, you can grant the BROWSE privilege, currently in public preview. You no longer require the Data Reader preset that granted the following privileges on objects in the catalog - USE CATALOG, USE SCHEMA, EXECUTE, READ VOLUME, and SELECT. To grant permissions to a user or service principal: Log in to your Databricks workspace as a workspace admin. From the left  of your workspace, click Catalog. In the left  of the Catalog Explorer page, select the catalog you want to crawl in Atlan. From the tabs along the top of your workspace page, click the Permissions tab and then click the Grant button. In the Grant on (workspace name) dialog, configure the following: Under Principals, click the dropdown and then select the user or service principal. Under Privileges, check the BROWSE privilege. At the bottom of the dialog, click Grant. (Optional) Repeat steps 3-5 for each catalog you want to crawl in Atlan. System tables extraction method​ To crawl metadata via system tables, you must have a Unity Catalog-enabled workspace and a configured SQL warehouse. Follow these steps to extract metadata using system tables: Create one of the following authentication methods: Personal access token AWS service principal Azure service principal Grant the following privileges to the identity you created: CAN_USE on a SQL warehouse USE CATALOG on system catalog USE SCHEMA on system.information_schema SELECT on the following tables: system.information_schema.catalogs system.information_schema.schemata system.information_schema.tables system.information_schema.columns system.information_schema.key_column_usage system.information_schema.table_constraints Cross-workspace extraction Public Preview​ To crawl metadata from all workspaces within a Databricks metastore using a single connection, see Set up cross-workspace extraction for instructions. (Optional) Grant permissions to query and preview data​ Important!Atlan currently only supports querying data and viewing sample data preview for the personal access token authentication method. To grant permissions to query data and preview example data: Log in to your Databricks workspace as a workspace admin. From the left  of your workspace, click Catalog. In the left  of the Catalog Explorer page, select the catalog you want to query and preview data from in Atlan. From the tabs along the top of your workspace page, click the Permissions tab and then click the Grant button. In the Grant on (workspace name) dialog, configure the following: Under Principals, click the dropdown and then select the user or service principal. Under Privilege presets, click the dropdown and then click Data Reader to enable read-only access to the catalog. Doing so automatically selects the following privileges - USE CATALOG, USE SCHEMA, EXECUTE, READ VOLUME, and SELECT. At the bottom of the dialog, click Grant. (Optional) Repeat steps 3-5 for each catalog you want to query and preview data from in Atlan. (Optional) Grant permissions to import and update tags​ To import Databricks tags, you must have a Unity Catalog-enabled workspace and a SQL warehouse configured. Atlan supports importing Databricks tags using system tables for all three authentication methods. Once you have created a personal access token, an AWS service principal, or an Azure service principal, you need to grant the following privileges: CAN_USE on a SQL warehouse USE CATALOG on system catalog USE SCHEMAon system.information_schema SELECT on the following tables: system.information_schema.catalog_tags system.information_schema.schema_tags system.information_schema.table_tags system.information_schema.column_tags To push tags updated for assets in Atlan to Databricks, you need to grant the following privileges: APPLY TAG on the object USE CATALOG on the object's parent catalog USE SCHEMA on the object's parent schema (Optional) Grant permissions to extract lineage and usage from system tables​ You must have a Unity Catalog-enabled workspace to use system tables. Atlan supports extracting the following for your Databricks assets using system tables: lineage usage and popularity metrics Enable system.access schema​ You need your account admin to enable the system.access schema using the SystemSchemas API. This enables Atlan to extract lineage using system tables. In Atlan, one Databricks connection corresponds to one metastore. Repeat the following process for each metastore in your Databricks environment for which you want to extract lineage. To verify that system schemas are enabled for each schema, follow the steps in Databricks documentation: List system schemas using the SystemSchemas API to check the status. If enabled for any given schema, the state is EnableCompleted. This confirms that the schema has been enabled for that specific metastore. Atlan can only extract lineage using system tables when the state is marked as EnableCompleted. (Optional) enable system.information_schema.table​ To generate lineage with the target type set as PATH for a table, Atlan uses metadata from system.information_schema.table to resolve table paths and dependencies. To enable this, you must grant the following permissions on the relevant catalog, schema, and tables. Grant permissions​ Who can do this?You must be a metastore admin, have the MANAGE privilege on the object, or be the owner of the catalog, schema, or table to grant these permissions. In Atlan, one Databricks connection corresponds to one metastore. Repeat the following process for each metastore from which you want to extract lineage. Open Catalog Explorer in your Databricks workspace. Navigate to the catalog (for example, main) and then to the appropriate schema (for example, sales). Click the Permissions tab. Click Grant. Enter the user or group name (principal). Assign the following permissions: USAGE on the catalog USAGE on the schema SELECT on each relevant table Click Grant to apply the changes. These privileges enable Atlan to read table definitions and other metadata from the metastore. (Optional) enable system.query schema​ This is only required if you also want to extract usage and popularity metrics from Databricks. You need your account admin to enable the system.query schema using the SystemSchemas API. This enables Atlan to mine query history using system tables for usage and popularity metrics. To verify that system schemas is enabled for each schema, follow the steps in Databricks documentation. If enabled for any given schema, the state is EnableCompleted. info💪 Did you know? Can't grant SELECT permissions on the system tables in system.access and system.query? Skip the previous steps and create cloned views in a separate catalog and schema. See Create cloned views of system tables. Grant permissions​ Atlan supports extracting Databricks lineage and usage and popularity metrics using system tables for all three authentication methods. Once you have created a personal access token, an AWS service principal, or an Azure service principal, you need to grant the following permissions: CAN_USE on a SQL warehouse USE_CATALOG on system catalog USE SCHEMA on system.access schema USE SCHEMA on system.query schema (tomine query history for usage and popularity metrics) SELECT on the following tables: system.query.history(to mine query history for usage and popularity metrics) system.access.table_lineage system.access.column_lineage You need to create a Databricks connection in Atlan for each metastore. You can use the hostname of your Unity Catalog-enabled workspace as the Host for the connection. info💪 Did you know? Can't grant SELECT permissions on the system tables in system.access and system.query? Skip the previous steps and create cloned views in a separate catalog and schema. See Create cloned views of system tables. (Optional) Create cloned views of system tables​ When you don't want to grant access to system tables directly, you can create cloned views to expose lineage and popularity metrics through a separate schema. Follow these steps to set up cloned views: Create a catalog and schema to store cloned views. Use meaningful and unique names—for example, atlan_cloned_catalog and atlan_cloned_schema. Create cloned views for the following system tables: Lineage tables CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW <cloned-catalog-name>.<cloned-schema-name>.column_lineage ASSELECT * FROM system.access.column_lineage;CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW <cloned-catalog-name>.<cloned-schema-name>.table_lineage ASSELECT * FROM system.access.table_lineage; Replace <cloned-catalog-name> and <cloned-schema-name> with the catalog and schema names used in your environment. Popularity metrics CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW <cloned-catalog-name>.<cloned-schema-name>.query_history ASSELECT * FROM system.query.history; Replace <cloned-catalog-name> and <cloned-schema-name> with the catalog and schema names used in your environment. Grant permissions​ Grant the following permissions to enable access to the cloned views: CAN_USE on a SQL warehouse USE CATALOG on the catalog (for example, <cloned-catalog-name>) USE SCHEMA and SELECT on the schema (for example, <cloned-catalog-name>.<cloned-schema-name>) You must create a Databricks connection in Atlan for each metastore. You can use the hostname of your Unity Catalog-enabled workspace as the Host for the connection. Locate warehouse ID​ To extract lineage and usage and popularity metrics using system tables, you also need the warehouse ID of your SQL warehouse. To locate the warehouse ID: Log in to your Databricks workspace as a workspace admin. From the left  of your workspace, click SQL Warehouses. On the Compute page, select the warehouse you want to use. From the Overview tab of your warehouse page, next to the Name of your warehouse, copy the value for your SQL warehouse ID. For example, example-warehouse (ID: 123ab4c5def67890), copy the value 123ab4c5def67890 and store it in a secure location. (Optional) Grant view permissions to access Databricks entities via APIs​ Atlan uses Databricks REST APIs to extract metadata for Notebooks, Queries, Jobs, and Pipelines. This information helps to understand which Databricks enitity was used to create a lineage between assets. Use the steps below for each object type to grant CAN VIEW permission to the Databricks user or service principal configured in your integration: Notebook API(/api/2.0/workspace/list): Grant CAN VIEW permission on individual notebooks, or on the workspace folder containing the notebooks, or on the entire workspace. For more information, see Manage Access Control Lists with Folders. Queries API(/api/2.0/sql/queries): Grant CAN VIEW permission on individual queries, or on the workspace folder containing the queries, or on the entire workspace. For more information, see View Queries. Job API(/api/2.2/jobs/list): Grant CAN VIEW permission on each job object directly. Databricks Jobs are distinct from notebooks or files and require permission set directly on the job object. For more information, see Control Access to a Job. Pipeline API(/api/2.0/pipelines): Grant CAN VIEW permission on each Delta Live Tables (DLT) pipeline object directly. For more information, see Configure Pipeline Permissions. (Optional) Grant permissions for views and materialized views​ Atlan requires the following permissions to to extract view definitions from and generate lineagefor views and materialized views: Log in to your Databricks workspace as a workspace admin. From the left  of your workspace, click Catalog. In the Catalog Explorer, select the catalog you want to extract view definitions from and generate lineage for in Atlan. From the tabs at the top, click the Permissions tab, and then click Grant. In the Grant on (workspace name) dialog, configure the following: Select the user or service principal under Principals. Select the following privileges under Privilege presets: USE CATALOG USE SCHEMA SELECT Click Grant to apply the permissions. Repeat steps 3–6 for each catalog you want to crawl in Atlan. Did you know?SELECT permission is required to extract the definitions of views and materialized views. If you prefer not to grant SELECT at the catalog level, you can grant it on individual views and materialized views instead. (Optional) Grant permissions to mine query history​ To mine query history using REST API, you need to assign the CAN MANAGE permission on your SQL warehouses to the user or service principal. To grant permissions to mine query history: Log in to your Databricks workspace as a workspace admin. From the left  of your workspace, click SQL Warehouses. On the Compute page, for each SQL warehouse you want to mine query history, click the 3-dot icon and then click Permissions. In the Manage permissions dialog, configure the following: In the Type to add multiple users or groups field, search for and select a user or service principal. Expand the Can use permissions dropdown and then select Can manage. This permission enables the service principal to view all queries for the warehouse. Click Add to assign the CAN MANAGE permission to the service principal.

Title: Set up Microsoft Power BI | Atlan Documentation
Content: Connect dataBI ToolsOn-premises & Enterprise BIMicrosoft Power BIGet StartedSet up Microsoft Power BIOn this pageSet up Microsoft Power BIWho can do this?Depending on the authentication method you choose, you may need a combination of your Cloud Application Administrator or Application Administrator for Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft 365 administrator for Microsoft 365, and Fabric Administrator (formerly known as Power BI Administrator) for Microsoft Power BI to complete these tasks -> you may not have access yourself. This guide outlines how to set up Microsoft Power BI so it can connect with Atlan for metadata extraction and lineage tracking. Before you begin​ Register application in Microsoft Entra ID​ Who can do this?You need your Cloud Application Administrator or Application Administrator to complete these steps—> you may not have access yourself. This is required if the creation of registered applications isn't enabled for the entire organization. To register a new application in Microsoft Entra ID: Log in to the Azure portal. Search for Microsoft Entra ID and select it. Click App registrations from the left . Click + New registration. Enter a name for your client application and click Register. From the Overview screen, copy and securely store: Application (client) ID Directory (tenant) ID Click Certificates & secrets from the left . Under Client secrets, click + New client secret. Enter a description, select an expiry time, and click Add. Copy and securely store the client secret Value. Create security group in Microsoft Entra ID​ Who can do this?You need your Cloud Application Administrator or Application Administrator to complete these steps - you may not have access yourself. To create a security group for your application: Log in to the Azure portal. Search for Microsoft Entra ID and select it. Click Groups under the Manage section. Click New group. Set the Group type to Security. Enter a Group name and optional description. Click No members selected. Add the appropriate member: For Delegated User authentication: search for the user and select it. For Service Principal authentication: search for the application registration created earlier and select it. Click Select and then Create. By the end of these steps, you have registered an application with Microsoft Entra ID and created a Security Group with the appropriate member. Configure authentication options​ Atlan supports two authentication methods for fetching metadata from Microsoft Power BI: Service principal authentication (recommended)​ When using Service Principal authentication, you must decide how the connector shall access metadata to catalog assets and build lineage. There are two supported options: Admin API only​ This option grants permissions that let the service principal to access only admin-level Power BI APIs. In this mode, Atlan extracts metadata exclusively using administrative endpoints. This option is recommended for stricter access control environments. Who can do this?You need your Fabric Administrator (formerly known as Power BI Administrator) to complete these tasks - you may not have access yourself. To configure admin API access: Log in to the Power BI admin portal. Click Tenant settings under Admin portal. Under Admin API settings: Expand Enable service principals to use read-only Power BI admin APIs and set to Enabled Add your security group under Specific security groups Click Apply Expand Enhance admin APIs responses with detailed metadata and set to Enabled Add your security group Click Apply Expand Enhance admin APIs responses with DAX and mashup expressions and set to Enabled Add your security group Click Apply Admin and non-admin APIs​ This option grants permissions that let the service principal to access both admin and non-admin Power BI APIs. This enables Atlan to extract richer metadata and build detailed lineage across Power BI assets. Assign security group to Power BI workspaces in PowerBI service portal​ Who can do this?You need to be at least a member of the Microsoft Power BI workspace to which you want to add the security group to complete these steps - you may not have access yourself. Make sure that you add the security group from the homepage and not the admin portal. To assign a Microsoft Power BI workspace role to the security group: Open the Microsoft Power BI homepage. Open Workspaces and select the workspace you want to access from Atlan. Click Access. In the panel: Enter the name of your security group where it says Enter email addresses Choose one of the following roles: Viewer: For workspaces without parameters Contributor: For workspaces with semantic models containing parameters or to generate lineage for measures Member: To generate lineage for dataflows Click Add. Configure admin and non-admin API access in PowerBI Service Portal​ Who can do this?You need your Fabric Administrator (formerly known as Power BI Administrator) to complete these tasks - you may not have access yourself. To enable both admin and non-admin API access: Log in to the Power BI admin portal. Click Tenant settings under Admin portal. Under Developer settings: Expand Service principals can use Fabric APIs and set to Enabled Add your security group under Specific security groups Click Apply Under Admin API settings: Expand Enable service principals to use read-only Power BI admin APIs and set to Enabled Add your security group Click Apply Expand Enhance admin APIs responses with detailed metadata and set to Enabled Add your security group Click Apply Expand Enhance admin APIs responses with DAX and mashup expressions and set to Enabled Add your security group Click Apply After making these changes, you typically need to wait 15-30 minutes for the settings to take effect across Microsoft's services. Delegated user authentication​ infoAtlan doesn't recommend using delegated user authentication as it's also not recommended by Microsoft. Fabric administrator role assignment​ Who can do this?You need your Microsoft 365 administrator to complete these steps - you may not have access yourself. To assign the delegated user to the Fabric Administrator role: Open the Microsoft 365 admin portal. Click Users and then Active users from the left . Select the delegated user. Under Roles, click Manage roles. Expand Show all by category. Under Collaboration, select Fabric Administrator. Click Save changes. API permissions​ Who can do this?You need your Cloud Application Administrator or Application Administrator to complete these steps, you may not have access yourself. warningThe following permissions are only required for delegated user authentication. If using service principal authentication, you don't need to configure any delegated permissions for a service principal—it's recommended that you avoid adding these permissions. These are never used and can cause errors that may be hard to troubleshoot. To add permissions for the registered application: In your app registration, click API permissions under the Manage section. Click Add a permission. Search for and select Power BI Service. Click Delegated permissions and select: Capacity.Read.All Dataflow.Read.All Dataset.Read.All Report.Read.All Tenant.Read.All Workspace.Read.All Click Grant Admin consent (If you only see the Add permissions button, you aren't an administrator). Admin API settings configuration​ Who can do this?You need your Fabric Administrator (formerly known as Power BI Administrator) to complete these tasks, you may not have access yourself. To enable the Microsoft Power BI admin API: Log in to the Power BI admin portal. Click Tenant settings under Admin portal. Under Admin API settings: Expand Enhance admin APIs responses with detailed metadata and set to Enabled Add your security group Click Apply Expand Enhance admin APIs responses with DAX and mashup expressions and set to Enabled Add your security group Click Apply.

Title: Administrators | Atlan Documentation
Content: Get StartedQuick Start GuidesAdministratorsOn this pageAdministratorsUser management​ User management is a critical part of data governance. Atlan's user management capabilities should be a mainstay of how you organize and control access for people in your organization. Add and manage users from the admin center​ It's super simple to invite and remove users from Atlan from the Admin center. You can also manage existing users by adding them to groups, changing their roles, or set up SSO, SCIM, and SMTP configurations. Manage access control from the governance center​ The Governance center is where you can build access control mechanisms to manage user access. Personas allow you to group users into teams, such as Financial Analysts or Cloud Engineers, and set policies based on the access those personas should have. Purposes are where you can build policies based on the actions or access that a user might need. For example, you can use Atlan's policy-based access controls to manage access to PII and other sensitive data. This is a best practice for data governance. Once you set these policies, Atlan will enforce them throughout your users' experience. This means that users who don't have access to a particular type of data will not be able to see it. Governance workflows help you set up robust controls on data access management, metadata enrichment, new entity creation, and more, with out-of-the-box workflow templates and automated execution. Asset profile​ The asset profile in Atlan gives you a quick and clear understanding of what a data asset contains. You can think of the asset profile as the TL;DR about your data. Glossary​ The Atlan glossary is a rich tool for defining and organizing your data terminology to improve transparency and share knowledge. No need to ask around for what a column name means. The glossary functions as a source of truth for teams to understand their data assets. Start keeping all your definitions in one searchable place. The glossary provides key intel on your data assets so you can quickly understand important attributes of your data, such as: Owners of your data, so you know who to ask for clarification. Certificate status, to easily understand if metadata enrichment is still in progress or the asset is ready to be used. Linked assets that are relevant to the term, so you can explore other helpful material. Did you know?The glossary helps power Atlan's powerful search tool, so tagging and defining assets are critical to helping your team find what they need. Discovery​ We rely on search bars to find things in almost every corner of the internet. Atlan uses a similar search tool to help you explore your data assets. The discovery tool is Atlan's powerful in-platform search, powered by the terms and descriptions you've added to your data assets.

Title: Secure Agent | Atlan Documentation
Content: Connect dataSecure AgentOn this pageSecure AgentThe Atlan Secure Agent is a lightweight, Kubernetes-based application that enables secure metadata extraction. It connects internal systems with Atlan SaaS while keeping sensitive data protected and doesn’t require inbound connectivity. Running within an organization’s controlled environment, the Secure Agent ensures compliance with security policies and automates metadata processing. Figure 1: The Secure Agent runs in the customer environment and acts as a gateway. Key capabilities​ The Secure Agent is designed for secure, scalable, and efficient metadata extraction. Security-first architecture​ Runs entirely within the organization's infrastructure, preventing secrets from leaving its boundary. Uses outbound, encrypted communication to interact with Atlan SaaS. Supports logging and monitoring and integrates with external monitoring systems for auditing and compliance. Scalable metadata extraction​ A single deployment of the Agent can connect to multiple source systems. Supports multiple concurrent metadata extraction jobs. Uses Kubernetes-based workloads for efficient resource management. Flexible deployment​ Deploys on cloud-based Kubernetes environments (such as Amazon EKS, Azure AKS, and Google GKE) or on-premises clusters. Scales dynamically based on workload demands. Automated operations​ Continuously monitors system health and sends heartbeats to Atlan. Captures and uploads execution logs for troubleshooting and auditing. Provides performance insights through metrics and alerts. How it works​ The Secure Agent follows a job-based execution model where metadata extraction tasks are scheduled and executed within the organization's environment. The workflow typically involves: Atlan triggers a metadata extraction job. The Secure Agent retrieves job details and extracts metadata using source-specific connectors. Extracted metadata is shared with Atlan either through cloud storage or direct ingestion. Atlan workflows process the extracted metadata and publish the assets. Logs and execution status are sent to Atlan for monitoring and auditing.

Title: Crawl Snowflake | Atlan Documentation
Content: Connect dataData WarehousesSnowflakeCrawl Snowflake AssetsCrawl SnowflakeOn this pageCrawl SnowflakeOnce you have configured the Snowflake user permissions, you can establish a connection between Atlan and Snowflake. (If you are also using AWS PrivateLink or Azure Private Link for Snowflake, you will need to set that up first, too.) To crawl metadata from Snowflake, review the order of operations and then complete the following steps. Select the source​ To select Snowflake as your source: In the top right of any screen, navigate to New and then click New Workflow. From the list of packages, select Snowflake Assets and click on Setup Workflow. Provide credentials​ Choose your extraction method: In Direct extraction, Atlan connects to your database and crawls metadata directly. In Offline extraction, you will need to first extract metadata yourself and make it available in S3. This is currently only supported when using the information schema extraction method to fetch metadata with basic authentication. In Agent extraction, Atlan's secure agent executes metadata extraction within the organization's environment. Direct extraction method​ To enter your Snowflake credentials: For Account Identifiers (Host), enter the hostname, AWS PrivateLink endpoint, or Azure Private Link endpoint for your Snowflake instance. For Authentication, choose the method you configured when setting up the Snowflake user: For Basic authentication, enter the Username and Password you configured in either Snowflake or the identity provider. info💪 Did you know? Snowflake recommends transitioning away from basic authentication using username and password. Change to key-pair authentication for enhanced security. For any existing Snowflake workflows, you can modify the crawler configuration to update the authentication method. For Keypair authentication, enter the Username, Encrypted Private Key, and Private Key Password you configured. Atlan only supports encrypted private keys with a non-empty passphrase - generally recommended as more secure. An empty passphrase will result in workflow failures. To generate an encrypted private key, refer to Snowflake documentation. For Okta SSO authentication, enter the Username, Password, and Authenticator you configured. The Authenticator will be the Okta URL endpoint of your Okta account, typically in the form of https://<okta_account_name>.okta.com. For Role, select the Snowflake role through which the crawler should run. For Warehouse, select the Snowflake warehouse in which the crawler should run. Click Test Authentication to confirm connectivity to Snowflake using these details. Once successful, at the bottom of the screen, click Next. Offline extraction method​ Atlan supports the offline extraction method for fetching metadata from Snowflake. This method uses Atlan's metadata-extractor tool to fetch metadata. You will need to first extract the metadata yourself and then make it available in S3. To enter your S3 details: For Bucket name, enter the name of your S3 bucket. If you are reusing Atlan's S3 bucket, you can leave this blank. For Bucket prefix, enter the S3 prefix under which all the metadata files exist. These include databases.json, columns-<database>.json, and so on. For Bucket region, enter the name of the S3 region. When complete, at the bottom of the screen, click Next. Configure the connection​ To complete the Snowflake connection configuration: Provide a Connection Name that represents your source environment. For example, you might use values like production, development, gold, or analytics. (Optional) To change the users able to manage this connection, change the users or groups listed under Connection Admins. warningIf you do not specify any user or group, nobody will be able to manage the connection - not even admins. (Optional) To prevent users from querying any Snowflake data, change Allow SQL Query to No. (Optional) To prevent users from previewing any Snowflake data, change Allow Data Preview to No. At the bottom of the screen, click Next to proceed. Agent extraction method​ Atlan supports using a Secure Agent for fetching metadata from Snowflake. To use a Secure Agent, follow these steps: Select the Agent tab. Configure the Snowflake data source by adding the secret keys for your secret store. For details on the required fields, refer to the Direct extraction section. Complete the Secure Agent configuration by following the instructions in the How to configure Secure Agent for workflow execution guide. Click Next after completing the configuration. Configure the crawler​ warningWhen modifying an existing Snowflake connection, switching to a different extraction method will delete and recreate all assets in the existing connection. If you'd like to change the extraction method, contact Atlan support for assistance. Before running the Snowflake crawler, you can further configure it. You must select the Extraction method you configured when you set up Snowflake: For Information Schema method, keep the default selection. Change to Account Usage method and specify the following: Database Name of the copied Snowflake database Schema Name of the copied ACCOUNT_USAGE schema Incremental extraction Public preview - Toggle incremental extraction for faster and more efficient metadata extraction. You can override the defaults for any of the remaining options: For Asset selection, select a filtering option: To select the assets you want to include in crawling, click Include by hierarchy and filter for assets down to the database or schema level. (This will default to all assets, if none are specified.) To have the crawler include Databases, Schemas, or Tables & Views based on a naming convention, click Include by regex and specify a regular expression - for example, specifying ATLAN_EXAMPLE_DB.* for Databases will include all the matching databases and their child assets. To select the assets you want to exclude from crawling, click Exclude by hierarchy and filter for assets down to the database or schema level. (This will default to no assets, if none are specified.) To have the crawler ignore Databases, Schemas, or Tables & Views based on a naming convention, click Exclude by regex and specify a regular expression - for example, specifying ATLAN_EXAMPLE_TABLES.* for Tables & Views will exclude all the matching tables and views. Click + to add more filters. If you add multiple filters, assets will be crawled based on matching all the filtering conditions you have set. To exclude lineage for views in Snowflake, change View Definition Lineage to No. To import tags from Snowflake to Atlan, change Import Tags to Yes. Note the following: If using the Account Usage extraction method, grant the same permissions as required for crawling Snowflake assets to import tags and push updated tags to Snowflake. If using the Information Schema extraction method, note that Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. You will need to grant permissions on the account usage schema instead to import tags from Snowflake. warningObject tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher. If your organization does not have Enterprise Edition or higher and you try to import Snowflake tags to Atlan, the Snowflake connection will fail with an error - unable to retrieve tags. For Control Config, keep Default for the default configuration or click Custom to further configure the crawler: If you have received a custom crawler configuration from Atlan support, for Custom Config, enter the value provided. You can also: Enter {"ignore-all-case": true} to enable crawling assets with case-sensitive identifiers. For Enable Source Level Filtering, click True to enable schema-level filtering at source or keep False to disable it. For Use JDBC Internal Methods, click True to enable JDBC internal methods for data extraction or click False to disable it. For Exclude tables with empty data, change to Yes to exclude any tables and corresponding columns without any data. For Exclude views, change to Yes to exclude all views from crawling. Did you know?If an asset appears in both the include and exclude filters, the exclude filter takes precedence. Run the crawler​ To run the Snowflake crawler, after completing the steps above: To check for any permissions or other configuration issues before running the crawler, click Preflight checks. You can either: To run the crawler once immediately, at the bottom of the screen, click the Run button. To schedule the crawler to run hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly, at the bottom of the screen, click the Schedule Run button. Once the crawler has completed running, you will see the assets in Atlan's asset page! 🎉 Note that the Atlan crawler will currently skip any unsupported data types to ensure a successful workflow run.Tags:connectorsdatacrawlPreviousHow to enable Snowflake OAuthNextMine SnowflakeSelect the sourceProvide credentialsConfigure the connectionConfigure the crawlerRun the crawler

Atlan IP not allowlisted Atlan's current location or network isn't recognized by Snowflake's security settings. This can happen if Atlan's IP address isn't on the list of allowed addresses in Snowflake's network policies. If you are using the IP allowlist in your Snowflake instance, you must add the Atlan IP to the allowlist. Contact Atlan support to obtain Atlan's IP addresses. Incorrect credentials The username or the password provided to connect to the Snowflake account is incorrect. Sign into the Snowflake account for the specified host and verify that the username and password are correct. You can also create a new user, if required, by following the steps here. Missing or unauthorized role The role specified in your connection configuration doesn't exist in Snowflake or your user account doesn't have grant to use this role. If the role does not exist or is missing the required grants, create a role and then grant the role to the user. User account locked The user account you're using to connect to Snowflake has been locked temporarily because of multiple incorrect login attempts. Wait for the user account to unlock or create a different user account to continue. Missing or unauthorized warehouse The warehouse specified in your connection configuration doesn't exist in Snowflake or your user account doesn't have grant to use this warehouse. Ensure that the warehouse name is configured correctly. Update the warehouse name in the configuration if your account is using a different warehouse. Create a role and then grant the role to the user for the updated warehouse. Missing access to non-system databases or schemas The configured user doesn't have usage grants to any database or schema. or The configured user doesn't have usage grants to any non-system database or schema. This pertains to the information schema method of fetching metadata. Ensure that the user has authorized access to the databases and schemas to be crawled. Grant the requisite permissions as outlined here. Why are some assets from a database or schema missing?​ Check the grants on the role attached to the user defined for the crawler. Ensure the missing database or schema is present in these grants. SHOW GRANTS TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Why are new tables or views missing?​ When using incremental extraction, consider running a one-time full extraction to capture any newly introduced metadata. Make sure the role attached to the user defined for the crawler has grants for future tables and views being created in the database: GRANT USAGE ON FUTURE SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE TABLES IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE VIEWS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role;GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO ROLE atlan_user_role; Make sure you run the below commands as well so that new tables and views you've created in-between are also visible to the user: GRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO role atlan_user_role; GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO role atlan_user_role; GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO atlan_user_role;GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE "<database-name>" TO role atlan_user_role; Why is some lineage missing?​ The query miner only mines query history for up to the previous two weeks. The miner will not mine any queries that ran before that time window. If the queries that created your assets ran before that time window, lineage for those assets will not be present. To mine more than the previous two weeks of query history, either use S3-based query mining or contact Atlan support. Note that Snowflake itself only retains query history for so long as well, though. Once Snowflake itself no longer contains the query history we will be unable to mine it for lineage. Lineage is unsupported for parameterized queries. Snowflake currently does not resolve values for parameterized queries before logging them in query history. This limits Atlan from generating lineage in such cases. Missing attributes and lineage​ When using the account usage extraction method, there are currently some limitations. We are working with Snowflake to find workarounds for crawling the following: External table location data Procedures Primary key designation Furthermore, only database-level filtering is currently possible. What views does Atlan require access to for the account usage method?​ When using the account usage method for fetching metadata, Atlan requires access to the following views in Snowflake: For the crawler: DATABASES, SCHEMATA, TABLES, VIEWS, COLUMNS, and PIPES For the miner and popularity metrics: QUERY_HISTORY, ACCESS_HISTORY, and SESSIONS Why am I getting a destination URL mismatch error when authenticating via Okta SSO?​ This error can occur when you're connecting to Snowflake through Okta SSO and enter the URL of your Snowflake instance in a format different from the one used in Okta. Snowflake follows two URL formats: Legacy format - <AccountLocator>.<Region>.snowflakecomputing.com or <AccountLocator>.<Region>.<cloud>.snowflakecomputing.com New URL format - <Orgname>-<AccountName>.snowflakecomputing.com Ensure that you're using the same Snowflake URL format in Snowflake and Okta. Refer to Snowflake documentation to learn more. Why am I getting a 'name or service not known' error when connecting via private link?​ If you're getting the following error messages - java.net.UnknownHostException and Name or service not known - this is a known error for users who have upgraded to the Snowflake JDBC driver version 3.13.25., have underscores in their account name, and connect to their Snowflake accounts over private link (for example, https://my_account.us-west-2.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com). If your Snowflake account name has an underscore - for example, my_account - the updated JDBC driver will automatically convert underscores to dashes or hyphens -. This does not affect normal URLs because Snowflake accepts URLs with both hyphens and underscores. For private link users, however, the JDBC driver will return an error if there are underscores present in the account name and the connection will fail. To troubleshoot further, refer to Snowflake documentation.Tags:atlandocumentationPreviousPreflight checks for SnowflakeNextTroubleshooting Snowflake tag management

Title: Mine Snowflake | Atlan Documentation
Content: Connect dataData WarehousesSnowflakeCrawl Snowflake AssetsMine SnowflakeOn this pageMine SnowflakeOnce you have crawled assets from Snowflake, you can mine its query history to construct lineage. To mine lineage from Snowflake, review the order of operations and then complete the following steps. Select the miner​ To select the Snowflake miner: In the top right of any screen, navigate to New and then click New Workflow. From the filters along the top, click Miner. From the list of packages, select Snowflake Miner and then click Setup Workflow. Configure the miner​ To configure the Snowflake miner: For Connection, select the connection to mine. (To select a connection, the crawler must have already run.) For Miner Extraction Method, select Source, Agent, or see the separate instructions for the S3 miner. For Snowflake Database: If the connection is configured with access to the snowflake database, choose Default. If the connection can only access a separate cloned database, choose Cloned Database. If you are using a cloned database, enter the name of the cloned database in Database Name and the name of the cloned schema in Schema Name. For Start time, choose the earliest date from which to mine query history. info💪 Did you know? The miner restricts you to only querying the past two weeks of query history. If you need to query more history, for example in an initial load, consider using the S3 miner first. After the initial load, you can modify the miner's configuration to use query history extraction. To check for any permissions or other configuration issues before running the miner, click Preflight checks. At the bottom of the screen, click Next to proceed. Agent extraction method​ Atlan supports using a Secure Agent for mining query history from Snowflake. To use a Secure Agent, follow these steps: Important!Query redaction is a compute-intensive operation and can impact workflow performance. To use this feature effectively, assign at least 4 CPU cores to the agent. Select the Agent tab. Configure Query Redaction: By default, Query Redaction is turned off. You may choose to configure query redaction: Set Enable Query Redaction flag to true if you want to redact PII data from query history before ingesting it to Atlan. Configure PII Patterns for Query Redaction: Define patterns to identify and redact sensitive information using the following JSON format: { "pii_patterns": [ { "name": "email", "regex": "\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Za-z]{2,}\\b", "replacement": "[EMAIL]" } ]} Configure the Snowflake data source by adding the secret keys for your secret store. For details on the required fields, refer to the connection configuration used when crawling Snowflake. Complete the Secure Agent configuration by following the instructions in the How to configure Secure Agent for workflow execution guide. Click Next after completing the configuration. Important!If running the miner for the first time, Atlan recommends setting a start date around three days prior to the current date and then scheduling it daily to build up to two weeks of query history. Mining two weeks of query history on the first miner run may cause delays. For all subsequent runs, Atlan requires a minimum lag of 24 to 48 hours to capture all the relevant transformations that were part of a session. Learn more about the miner logic here. Configure the miner behavior​ To configure the Snowflake miner behavior: (Optional) For Calculate popularity, keep True to retrieve usage and popularity metrics for your Snowflake assets from query history. For Excluded Users, type the names of users to be excluded while calculating usage metrics for Snowflake assets. Press Enter after each name to add more names. (Optional) For Advanced Config, keep Default for the default configuration or click Custom to configure the miner: If Atlan support has provided you with a custom control configuration, enter the configuration into the Custom Config box. You can also enter {“ignore-all-case”: true} to enable crawling assets with case-sensitive identifiers. For Popularity Window (days), 90 days is the maximum limit. You can set a shorter popularity window of less than 90 days. Run the miner​ To run the Snowflake miner, after completing the configuration steps: To run the miner once immediately, at the bottom of the screen, click the Run button.

Content: Connect dataData WarehousesSnowflakeManage Snowflake in AtlanManage Snowflake tagsOn this pageManage Snowflake tagsNote that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher. Atlan enables you to import your Snowflake tags, update your Snowflake assets with the imported tags, and push the tag updates back to Snowflake: Import tags - crawl Snowflake tags from Snowflake to Atlan Reverse sync - sync Snowflake tag updates from Atlan to Snowflake Once you've imported your Snowflake tags to Atlan: Your Snowflake assets in Atlan are automatically enriched with their Snowflake tags. Imported Snowflake tags are mapped to corresponding Atlan tags through case-insensitive name match - multiple Snowflake tags can be matched to a single tag in Atlan. You can also attach Snowflake tags, including tag values, to your Snowflake assets in Atlan - allowing you to categorize your assets at a more granular level. Atlan supports: Allowed values: attach an allowed value from a predefined list of values imported from Snowflake. Tag values: enter any value in Atlan while attaching or editing imported Snowflake tags on an asset. You can enable reverse sync to push any tag updates for your Snowflake assets back to Snowflake - including allowed and tag values added to assets in Atlan. You can filter your assets by Snowflake tags and tag and allowed values. Did you know?Enabling reverse sync only updates existing tags in Snowflake. It neither creates nor deletes any tags in Snowflake. Prerequisites​ Did you know?Additional privileges are only required when using the information schema method for fetching metadata. This is because Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. If you're using the account usage method to crawl metadata in Atlan or you have configured the Snowflake miner, any permissions required are already set. Account usage method​ Before you can import tags from Snowflake, you need to do the following: Create tags or have existing tags in Snowflake. Grant the same permissions as required for crawling Snowflake assets to import tags and push updated tags to Snowflake. Information schema method​ Before you can import tags from Snowflake, you need to do the following: Create tags or have existing tags in Snowflake. Grant additional permissions to import tags from Snowflake. Grant additional permissions to push updated tags to Snowflake. Import Snowflake tags to Atlan​ Who can do this?You need to be an admin user in Atlan to import Snowflake tags to Atlan. You also need to work with your Snowflake administrator to grant additional permissions to import tags from Snowflake - you may not have access yourself. You can import your Snowflake tags to Atlan through one-way tag sync. The synced Snowflake tags are matched to corresponding tags in Atlan through case-insensitive name match and your Snowflake assets are enriched with their synced tags from Snowflake. To import Snowflake tags to Atlan, you can either: Create a new Snowflake workflow and configure the crawler to import tags. Modify the crawler's configuration for an existing Snowflake workflow to change Import Tags to Yes. If you subsequently modify the workflow to disable tag import, for any tags already imported, Atlan preserves those tags. Once the crawler has completed running, tags imported from Snowflake are available to use for tagging assets! 🎉 View Snowflake tags in Atlan​ Once you've imported your Snowflake tags, you can view and manage your Snowflake tags in Atlan. To view Snowflake tags: From the left  of any screen, click Governance. Under the Governance heading of the _Governance cente_r, click Tags. (Optional) Under Tags, click the funnel icon to filter tags by source type. Click Snowflake to filter for tags imported from Snowflake. From the left  under Tags, select a synced tag - synced tags display the Snowflake ❄️ icon next to the tag name. In the Overview section, you can view a total count of synced Snowflake tags. To the right of Overview, click Synced tags to view additional details - including tag name, description, tag values, total count of linked assets, connection, database, and schema names, and timestamp for last synced. (Optional) Click the Linked assets tab to view linked assets for your Snowflake tag. (Optional) In the top right, click the pencil icon to add a description and change the tag icon. You can't rename tags synced from Snowflake. Push tag updates to Snowflake​ Who can do this?Any admin or member user in Atlan can configure reverse sync for tag updates to Snowflake. You also need to work with your Snowflake administrator to grant additional permissions to push updates - you may not have access yourself. Did you know?Reverse sync is currently only available for imported Snowflake tags in Atlan. The imported tags display a Snowflake ❄️ icon next to the tag name. If using the account usage method, expect a data latency of up to 3 hours for reverse tag sync to be successful. You can enable reverse sync for your imported Snowflake tags in Atlan and push all tag updates for your Snowflake assets back to source. Once you have enabled reverse sync, any Snowflake assets with tags updated in Atlan are also updated in Snowflake. To enable reverse sync for imported Snowflake tags: From the left  of any screen, click Governance. Under the Governance heading of the _Governance cente_r, click Tags. (Optional) Under Tags, click the funnel icon to filter tags by source type. Click Snowflake to filter for tags imported from Snowflake. In the left  under Tags, select a synced Snowflake tag - synced tags display the Snowflake ❄️ icon next to the tag name. On your selected tag page, to the right of Overview, click Synced tags. Under Synced tags, in the upper right, turn on Enable reverse sync to synchronize tag updates from Atlan to Snowflake. In the advanced settings, you can also enable concatenation to support multiple tag values for a single column. For detailed information about multiple tag values and concatenation, see Multiple tag values and concatenation. In the corresponding confirmation dialog, click Yes, enable it to enable reverse tag sync or click Cancel. Now when you attach Snowflake tags to your Snowflake assets in Atlan, these tag updates are also pushed to Snowflake! 🎉 Did you know?Enabling reverse sync won't trigger any updates in Snowflake until synced tags are attached to Snowflake assets in Atlan.

Title: Set up an AWS private network link to Snowflake | Atlan Documentation
Content: Connect dataData WarehousesSnowflakeGet StartedSet up an AWS private network link to SnowflakeOn this pageSet up an AWS private network link to SnowflakeAWS PrivateLink creates a secure, private connection between services running in AWS. This document describes the steps to set this up between Snowflake and Atlan, when you use our Single Tenant SaaS deployment. Who can do this?You will need Snowflake Support, and probably your Snowflake administrator involved - you may not have access or the tools to run these tasks. Prerequisites​ Snowflake must be setup with Business Critical Edition (or higher). Open a ticket with Snowflake Support to enable PrivateLink for your Snowflake account. Snowflake support will take 1-2 days to review and enable PrivateLink. If you are using IP allowlist in your Snowflake instance, you must add the Atlan IP to the allowlist. Please raise a support request to do so. (For all details, see the Snowflake documentation.) Fetch PrivateLink information​ Log in to snowCLI using the ACCOUNTADMIN account, and run the following commands: use role accountadmin;select system$get_privatelink_config(); This will produce output like the following (formatted here for readability): { "privatelink-account-name":"abc123.ap-south-1.privatelink", "privatelink-vpce-id":"com.amazonaws.vpce.ap-south-1.vpce-svc-257a4d536bd8e3594", "privatelink-account-url":"abc123.ap-south-1.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com", "regionless-privatelink-account-url":"xyz789-abc123.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com", "privatelink_ocsp-url":"ocsp.abc123.ap-south-1.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com", "privatelink-connection-urls":"[]"} Share details with Atlan support team​ Share the following values with the Atlan support team: privatelink-account-name privatelink-vpce-id privatelink-account-url privatelink_ocsp-url Atlan support will finish the configuration on the Atlan side using these values. Support will then provide the Snowflake PrivateLink endpoint back to you. When you use this endpoint in the configuration for crawling and mining, Atlan will connect to Snowflake over the PrivateLink.Tags:atlandocumentationPreviousSet up SnowflakeNextSet up an Azure private network link to SnowflakePrerequisitesFetch PrivateLink informationShare details with Atlan support team

Title: Crawl Databricks | Atlan Documentation
Content: Connect dataData WarehousesDatabricksCrawl Databricks AssetsCrawl DatabricksOn this pageCrawl DatabricksOnce you have configured the Databricks access permissions, you can establish a connection between Atlan and your Databricks instance. (If you are also using AWS PrivateLink or Azure Private Link for Databricks, you will need to set that up first, too.) To crawl metadata from your Databricks instance, review the order of operations and then complete the following steps. Select the source​ To select Databricks as your source: In the top right corner of any screen, navigate to New and then click New Workflow. From the list of packages, select Databricks Assets, and click Setup Workflow. Provide credentials​ Choose your extraction method: In Direct extraction, Atlan connects to your database and crawls metadata directly. Next, select an authentication method: In JDBC, you will need a personal access token and HTTP path for authentication. In AWS Service, you will need a client ID and client secret for AWS service principal authentication. In Azure Service, you will need a tenant ID, client ID, and client secret for Azure service principal authentication. In Offline extraction, you will need to first extract metadata yourself and make it available in S3. In Agent extraction, Atlan's secure agent executes metadata extraction within the organization's environment. Direct extraction method​ JDBC​ To enter your Databricks credentials: For Host, enter the hostname, AWS PrivateLink endpoint, or Azure Private Link endpoint for your Databricks instance. For Port, enter the port number of your Databricks instance. For Personal Access Token, enter the access token you generated when setting up access. For HTTP Path, enter one of the following: A path starting with /sql/1.0/warehouses to use the Databricks SQL warehouse. A path starting with sql/protocolv1/o to use the Databricks interactive cluster. Click Test Authentication to confirm connectivity to Databricks using these details. Once successful, at the bottom of the screen click Next. warningMake sure your Databricks instance (SQL warehouse or interactive cluster) is up and running, otherwise the Test Authentication step times out. AWS service principal​ To enter your Databricks credentials: For Host, enter the hostname or AWS PrivateLink endpoint for your Databricks instance. For Port, enter the port number of your Databricks instance. For Client ID, enter the client ID for your AWS service principal. For Client Secret, enter the client secret for your AWS service principal. Click Test Authentication to confirm connectivity to Databricks using these details. Once successful, at the bottom of the screen click Next. Azure service principal​ To enter your Databricks credentials: For Host, enter the hostname or Azure Private Link endpoint for your Databricks instance. For Port, enter the port number of your Databricks instance. For Client ID, enter the application (client) ID for your Azure service principal. For Client Secret, enter the client secret for your Azure service principal. For Tenant ID, enter the directory (tenant) ID for your Azure service principal. Click Test Authentication to confirm connectivity to Databricks using these details. Once successful, at the bottom of the screen click Next. Offline extraction method​ Atlan supports the offline extraction method for fetching metadata from Databricks. This method uses Atlan's databricks-extractor tool to fetch metadata. You need to first extract the metadata yourself and then make it available in S3. To enter your S3 details: For Bucket name, enter the name of your S3 bucket. For Bucket prefix, enter the S3 prefix under which all the metadata files exist. These include output/databricks-example/catalogs/success/result-0.json, output/databricks-example/schemas/{{catalog_name}}/success/result-0.json, output/databricks-example/tables/{{catalog_name}}/success/result-0.json, and similar files. (Optional) For Bucket region, enter the name of the S3 region. When complete, at the bottom of the screen, click Next. Agent extraction method​ Atlan supports using a Secure Agent for fetching metadata from Databricks. To use a Secure Agent, follow these steps: Select the Agent tab. Configure the Databricks data source by adding the secret keys for your secret store. For details on the required fields, refer to the Direct extraction section. Complete the Secure Agent configuration by following the instructions in the How to configure Secure Agent for workflow execution guide. Click Next after completing the configuration. Configure the connection​ To complete the Databricks connection configuration: Provide a Connection Name that represents your source environment. For example, you might want to use values like production, development, gold, or analytics. (Optional) To change the users able to manage this connection, change the users or groups listed under Connection Admins. warningIf you don't specify any user or group, nobody can manage the connection - not even admins. (Optional) To prevent users from querying any Databricks data, change Enable SQL Query to No. (Optional) To prevent users from previewing any Databricks data, change Enable Data Preview to No. (Optional) To prevent users from running large queries, change Max Row Limit or keep the default selection. At the bottom of the screen, click the Next button to proceed. Configure the crawler​ Before running the Databricks crawler, you can further configure it. System tables extraction method​ The system metadata extraction method is only available for Unity Catalog-enabled workspaces. It provides access to detailed metadata from system tables and supports all three authentication types. You can extract metadata from your Databricks workspace using this method. Follow these steps: Set up authentication using one of the following: Personal access token AWS service principal Azure service principal The default options can work as is. You may choose to override the defaults for any of the remaining options: For Asset selection, select a filtering option: For SQL warehouse, click the dropdown to select the SQL warehouse you want to configure. To select the assets you want to include in crawling, click Include by hierarchy and filter for assets down to the database or schema level. (This defaults to all assets, if none are specified.) To have the crawler include Databases, Schemas, or Tables & Views based on a naming convention, click Include by regex and specify a regular expression - for example, specifying ATLAN_EXAMPLE_DB.* for Databases includes all the matching databases and their child assets. To select the assets you want to exclude from crawling, click Exclude by hierarchy and filter for assets down to the database or schema level. (This defaults to no assets, if none are specified.) To have the crawler ignore Databases, Schemas, or Tables & Views based on a naming convention, click Exclude by regex and specify a regular expression - for example, specifying ATLAN_EXAMPLE_TABLES.* for Tables & Views excludes all the matching tables and views. Click + to add more filters. If you add multiple filters, assets are crawled based on matching all the filtering conditions you have set. To import tags from Databricks to Atlan, change Import Tags to Yes. Note that you must have a Unity Catalog-enabled workspace to import Databricks tags in Atlan. Did you know?If an asset appears in both the include and exclude filters, the exclude filter takes precedence. Incremental extraction​ Toggle incremental extraction, for a faster and more efficient metadata extraction. JDBC extraction method​ The JDBC extraction method uses JDBC queries to extract metadata from your Databricks instance. This was the original extraction method provided by Databricks. This extraction method is only supported for personal access token authentication. You can override the defaults for any of these options: To select the assets you want to include in crawling, click Include Metadata. (This will default to all assets, if none are specified.) To select the assets you want to exclude from crawling, click Exclude Metadata. (This will default to no assets if none are specified.) To have the crawler ignore tables and views based on a naming convention, specify a regular expression in the Exclude regex for tables & views field. For View Definition Lineage, keep the default Yes to generate upstream lineage for views based on the tables referenced in the views or click No to exclude from crawling. For Advanced Config, keep Default for the default configuration or click Advanced to further configure the crawler: To enable or disable schema-level filtering at source, click Enable Source Level Filtering and select True to enable it or False to disable it. REST API extraction method​ The REST API extraction method uses Unity Catalog to extract metadata from your Databricks instance. This extraction method is supported for all three authentication options: personal access token, AWS service principal, and Azure service principal. This method is only supported by Unity Catalog-enabled workspaces. If you enable an existing workspace, you also need to upgrade your tables and views to Unity Catalog. While REST APIs are used to extract metadata, JDBC queries are still used for querying purposes. You can override the defaults for any of these options: Change the extraction method under Extraction method to REST API. To select the assets you want to include in crawling, click Include Metadata. (This will default to all assets, if none are specified.) To select the assets you want to exclude from crawling, click Exclude Metadata. (This will default to no assets if none are specified.) To import tags from Databricks to Atlan, change Import Tags to Yes. Note that you must have a Unity Catalog-enabled workspace to import Databricks tags in Atlan. For SQL warehouse, click the dropdown to select the SQL warehouse you have configured. Did you know?If an asset appears in both the include and exclude filters, the exclude filter takes precedence. Run the crawler​ Follow these steps to run the Databricks crawler: To check for any permissions or other configuration issues before running the crawler, click Preflight checks. You can either: To run the crawler once immediately, at the bottom of the screen, click the Run button. To schedule the crawler to run hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly, at the bottom of the screen, click the Schedule Run button. Once the crawler has completed running, you will see the assets in Atlan's asset page! 🎉Tags:connectorsdatacrawlsetupPreviousSet up cross-workspace extractionNextSet up on-premises Databricks accessSelect the sourceProvide credentialsConfigure the connectionConfigure the crawlerRun the crawler

Title: Set up cross-workspace extraction | Atlan Documentation
Content: Connect dataData WarehousesDatabricksCross-workspace SetupSet up cross-workspace extractionOn this pageSet up cross-workspace extractionEliminate the need for separate crawler configurations by using a single service principal to crawl metadata from all workspaces within a Databricks metastore. This guide walks you through configuring the necessary permissions to enable cross-workspace extraction. Important!Cross-workspace extraction isn't supported for REST API or JDBC extraction methods. Prerequisites​ Before you begin, make sure you have: A Unity Catalog-enabled Databricks workspace Account admin access to create and manage service principals Workspace admin access to grant permissions across all target workspaces At least one active SQL warehouse in each workspace you intend to crawl Set up Databricks authentication completed with one of the supported authentication methods System table extraction enabled for lineage and usage extraction Add service principal to all workspaces​ You must use a single, common service principal that has been granted access to all Databricks workspaces you intend to crawl within the metastore. Log in to your Databricks account console as an account admin From the left , click Workspaces and select a workspace From the tabs along the top, click the Permissions tab In the upper right, click Add permissions In the Add permissions dialog: For User, group, or service principal, select your service principal For Permission, select workspace User Click Add Repeat steps 2-5 for each workspace you intend to crawl Permissions required​ The service principal needs the following permissions on each workspace from which the you want Atlan to extract metadata and to enable cross-workspace extraction: CAN_USE on SQL warehouses in each workspace USE CATALOG on system catalog USE SCHEMA on system.access (for cross-workspace discovery) USE SCHEMA on system.information_schema SELECT on the following system tables: system.access.workspace_latest (for cross-workspace discovery) system.information_schema.catalogs system.information_schema.schemata system.information_schema.tables system.information_schema.columns system.information_schema.key_column_usage system.information_schema.table_constraints BROWSE on all catalogs you want to crawl Grant permissions​ Configure the necessary permissions for the service principal to access and extract metadata from all workspaces within the metastore. SQL workspace permissions: The service principal must have usage permissions on at least one active SQL warehouse within each workspace. The extractor uses the smallest available warehouse to run its discovery queries. Via SQLVia UI Connect to your Databricks workspace using a SQL client or the SQL editor Run the following command for each workspace, replacing the placeholders: GRANT CAN_USE ON WAREHOUSE <warehouse_name> TO `<service_principal_id>`; Replace <warehouse_name> with your actual warehouse name Replace <service_principal_id> with your service principal's application ID ExampleGRANT CAN_USE ON WAREHOUSE production-warehouse TO `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`; Log in to your Databricks workspace as a workspace admin From the left , click SQL Warehouses On the Compute page, for each SQL warehouse, click the 3-dot icon and then click Permissions In the Manage permissions dialog: In the Type to add multiple users or groups field, search for and select your service principal Select Can use permission Click Add to assign the permission System table permissions: Access to the system schema is essential for workspace and lineage discovery.

Title: Manage Databricks tags | Atlan Documentation
Content: Connect dataData WarehousesDatabricksTag managementManage Databricks tagsOn this pageManage Databricks tagsYou must have a Unity Catalog-enabled workspace to import Databricks tags in Atlan. Atlan enables you to import your Databricks tags, update your Databricks assets with the imported tags, and push the tag updates back to Databricks: Import tags - crawl Databricks tags from Databricks to Atlan Reverse sync - sync Databricks tag updates from Atlan to Databricks Once you've imported your Databricks tags to Atlan: Your Databricks assets in Atlan will be automatically enriched with their Databricks tags. Imported Databricks tags will be mapped to corresponding Atlan tags through case-insensitive name match - multiple Databricks tags can be matched to a single tag in Atlan. You can also attach Databricks tags, including tag values, to your Databricks assets in Atlan - allowing you to categorize your assets at a more granular level. You can filter your assets by Databricks tags and tag values. You can enable reverse sync to push any tag updates for your Databricks assets back to Databricks - including tag values added to assets in Atlan. Did you know?Enabling reverse sync will only update existing tags in Databricks. It will neither create nor delete any tags in Databricks. Prerequisites​ You must have a Unity Catalog-enabled workspace and SQL warehouse configured to import Databricks tags in Atlan. Before you can import tags from and push tag updates to Databricks using personal access token, AWS service principal, or Azure service principal authentication, you will need to do the following: Ensure that you have a Unity Catalog-enabled workspace and a SQL warehouse configured. Create tags or have existing tags in Databricks. Grant permissions to import tags from and push tag updates to Databricks. Import Databricks tags to Atlan​ Who can do this?You will need to be an admin user in Atlan to import Databricks tags to Atlan. You will also need to work with your Databricks administrator to grant permissions to import tags from Databricks - you may not have access yourself. You can import your Databricks tags to Atlan through one-way tag sync. The synced Databricks tags will be matched to corresponding tags in Atlan through case-insensitive name match and your Databricks assets will be enriched with their synced tags from Databricks. To import Databricks tags to Atlan, you can either: Create a new Databricks workflow and configure the crawler to import tags. Modify the crawler's configuration for an existing Databricks workflow to change Import Tags to Yes. If you subsequently modify the workflow to disable tag import, for any tags already imported, Atlan will preserve those tags. Once the crawler has completed running, tags imported from Databricks will be available to use for tagging assets! 🎉 View Databricks tags in Atlan​ Once you've imported your Databricks tags, you will be able to view and manage your Databricks tags in Atlan.
